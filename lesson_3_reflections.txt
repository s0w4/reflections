When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to be sure which version I'm working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    If I want to create my own version of someone's project, I will make a Fork.
    Clone allows me to clone the project into custom location, with a reference to the source.
    Branch allows the project's team to split to work on different functions and then merge
    into one branch again if needed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's useful for a periods without internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It will be easier if all team members will have a group chat and
    everyone could be notified about each others stage. Better if one person
    could work with particular file or folder. It will be hard to find a bug
    if there were a lot of changes made without notifications.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If the team is working on a project and I want to try experimental feature,
    then I will make a branch for it. So it will not affect other members workflow.
    And during straightforward workflow I will change just the master without branches.
